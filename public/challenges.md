 * Challenge: Check the dice array for these winning conditions:
 * 1. All dice are held, and
 * 2. all dice have the same value
 * 
 * If both conditions are true, set `tenzies` to true and log
 * "You won!" to the console


 /**
 * Challenge: Tie off loose ends!
 * 1. If tenzies is true, Change the button text to "New Game"
 * 2. If tenzies is true, use the "react-confetti" package to
 *    render the <Confetti /> component ðŸŽ‰
 * 
 *    Hint: don't worry about the `height` and `width` props
 *    it mentions in the documentation.
